Hi, I'm Mark.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Chemistry at the University of Oxford in 2010, before pursuing my PhD at the University of Reading under the supervision of [Professor Kenneth Shankland](https://www.reading.ac.uk/pharmacy/staff/professor-kenneth-shankland).

After working in higher education for a number of years, I recently accepted a role as a machine learning engineer.

When I'm not doing science, I enjoy BJJ, playing the drums and cooking.
